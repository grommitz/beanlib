beanlib
=======

Beanlib is a utility library for use with JavaBean. Beanlib for Hibernate in particular makes it easy for developers to reuse the same pojo classes for both persistence and data transfer objects. This enables clean data access API to be designed with pojos that are free of any hidden persistent state.

Forked from http://beanlib.sourceforge.net/ which is no longer maintained.
